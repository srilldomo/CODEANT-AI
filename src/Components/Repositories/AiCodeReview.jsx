      AI code review is the process of leveraging artificial intelligence to
      analyze, evaluate, and improve the quality of code. It automates the
      detection of bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and
      coding standard violations. AI-powered tools provide suggestions for
      optimization, ensure adherence to best practices, and enhance
      collaboration among developers. This accelerates development cycles,
      reduces human error, and ensures cleaner, more maintainable code.
